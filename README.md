The goal of this mobile-responsive application is to allow the user to search for concerts in cities within the state of North Carolina. When a city is searched, restaurants in the area are displayed as well.

## Description

To supply the application with content, API's (Application Programming Interface) are used to contact a server and retrieve selective information to display. Ticketmaster is used to pull data regarding concerts. More specifically, an image of the event, the day, date and time, the name of the event, the venue, and the city where the event is taking place are pulled from the API. A button is located on the page to direct the user to Ticketmaster's website where they can purchase tickets if desired. Ticketmaster's geolocation API was used to power Zomato to locate restaurants near the city searched. Zomato's API is used to retrieve data regarding restaurants located near the event. A button labeled 'View' is located where the Restaurants are displayed to direct the user to view restaurants in the area of the event.

Tasks and roles were broken down and assigned to group members based on coding strengths. 

There were a few challenges faced while creating the application. Searching for APIs that have proper documentation gave some trouble. For example, navigating the Zomato API was difficult finding what information was needed about restaurants to display on the application. 

Future development of the application would consist of broadening the radius of the APIs used to include concerts across the United States versus the current version that is capable of searching for concerts in North Carolina. Also, optimizing the code to create a more polished application would be ideal. Future versions may include events outside of concerts such as sporting events, comedy shows, family-focused events, and theatre shows. To make the application more user-friendly in the future, an option to buy the tickets in the application would be added.
